# Introducing JGrass

Welcome to the website for the Java Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (JGrass) Application. 
If you are reading this it is probably because you are exploring and checking out what other content is available.

JGrass is no longer under development under this project. Please have a look at the JGrasstools project, 
as that one contains everything developed for JGrass and has been enhanced during the years:
